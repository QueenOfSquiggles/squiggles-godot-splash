# Permissions / Use

This is under the MIT license, technically the sfx used are CC0 so I may be able to release under CC0 but I need to do some legal research.

*PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE* if this is useful to you, use it.

My intent is that the animation files could be easily used / edited from within the Godot Editor, but you could also use the rendered video files if you prefer.

The video files are intended for YouTube videos that discuss Godot or have some relation to the Godot Engine. If you have some kind of use case outside of this, feel free to use it!

# Requirements for use

None, however, I would really appreciate hearing that you are using it in your project/video/etc... Reach me at my [twitter](https://twitter.com/OfSquiggles)
